# 1 Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# = --> Assignment operator, values are assigned from right to variable name declared on left
# == --> Comparison operator used to compare two values

#2 What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# ** --> Refers to the power of any variable or value
#  num = 2**3
# print(num) --> 8

# 3 What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
# The ^ operator compares each bit and set it to 1 if only value is 1.
# else the value is set to zero if both are one or both are 0.

#1*1=0
#1*0=1
#0*1=1
#0*0=0

#Example

num=2^3
print(num)
num=2^2
print(num)
